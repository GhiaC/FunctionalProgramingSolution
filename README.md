Functional programming (FP) is a programming style emphasizing functions that return consistent and predictable results regardless of a program's state. As a result, functional code is easier to test and reuse, simpler to parallelize, and less prone to bugs. Scala is an emerging JVM language that offers strong support for FP. Its familiar syntax and transparent interoperability with existing Java libraries make Scala a great place to start learning FP.

Functional Programming in Scala is a serious tutorial for programmers looking to learn FP and apply it to the everyday business of coding. The book guides readers from basic techniques to advanced topics in a logical, concise, and clear progression. In it, they'll find concrete examples and exercises that open up the world of functional programming.
